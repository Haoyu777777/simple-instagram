Step 1: In this assignment you will be breaking ground on a photography application, beginning with the foundational classes Person and Photograph. These classes will define what it means to be a photograph and person and how they interact; specifically a person may post photographs to their photo feed.


Step 2: Our photo feeds have gotten out of control and we'd like to be able to organize our photos a little better, so we've introduced Albums! To implement this additional functionality, you will need to modify your original Person and Photograph classes and add an Album class.


Step 3: The project manager noticed the PhotoLibrary and Album classes have nearly identical functions with regard to a list of photographs and wants you to harness the power of inheritance to clean then up. Additionally, the project manager is aware that as a photo library grows, it will be helpful to be able to better manage large numbers of photos through sorting, searching, and other techniques. To that end, you have been requested to provide ways to compare Photographs as outlined below.


Step 4:  The project owner wants a Graphical User Interface (GUI) front-end to the PhotoLibrary application that we've been building. To start development of this application, you have been assigned to develop a prototype of the album viewer GUI.
